# CS445_Visual_Odometry
Final Project for CS 445 (2020)

## SIFT_plus_RANSAC
@ Details of Implementation:
- Modfied for Own dataset and SIFT Tracking
- Better Outlier rejection 
- Imporved flow tracking - minimized dynamic object keypoint selection 
- Scene -based masking

# Setup and excecution :
1. **DatasetReaderKITTI** is responsible for loading frames from [KITTI Visual Odometry Dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php)
2. Run keypoint detection using SIFT and then track these keypoints with **FeatureTracker** that uses OpenCV Sparse optical flow
3. Load calib.txt and poses.txt for the corresponding sequecne from [KITTI Visual Odometry Dataset], and Update Trajectory path while execution.
4. Scene-based masking: Mask sky region (1/4th of top frame) and edges of frame
5. Tune RANSAC theshold (if required) 

# own-dataset
1. Convert video to frames (resize if needed)
2. Setup data_directory to folder with video_frames

## SuperPoint_plus_RANSAC
ipython notebook:
This is the MagicLeap's implementation of SuperPoint
1. Load the pretrained weights for SuperPoint on MS-COCO [here](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperPointPretrainedNetwork/blob/master/superpoint_v1.pth)
2. Run the modified code to obtain optical flow track points generated by the tracker function 
3. Tune RANSAC theshold (if required) 
Creates comprartive plots for ground truth and proposed trajectories.

## KITTI dataset
### Raw data structure
- Download odometry data (grey) synced + rectified from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).
- Copy the ground truth poses from [here] (http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_odometry_poses.zip)
